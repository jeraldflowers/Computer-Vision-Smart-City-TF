# Computer-Vision-Smart-City-TF
In this computerized vision project with Tensor Flow, we made a counter for vehicles in transit, classifying them between cars and motorcycles to measure traffic on highways. The purpose is to be able to implement this learning model in a smart city and have better control by the municipalities.
